## General info

Welcome to the SafeHouse!
This project is BCIT's team project called Safehouse.
The Safe House app is designed to help evacuee to provide support for those affected by wildfires in British Columbia. If you are suddenly affected by a forest fire, the Safe House app can connect you with volunteers who are willing to provide a safe place for you to stay.
Using the app, volunteers can upload their home to the dashboard using SafeHouse, and evacuees can view available safe houses on the map or through the dashboard, which includes images and information about the homes. This allows evacuees to easily find and connect with volunteers who can provide a safe place to stay.

## Features
SafeHouse is built using Next.js and Firebase, and integrates with Google Maps and AutoComplete for easy location and information sharing.

# Getting Started

To get started with SafeHouse, simply download the app and create an account. If you are a volunteer and would like to offer your home as a safe place for evacuees, you can upload your home to the dashboard using Google AutoComplete. If you have been affected by a forest fire and are in need of a safe place to stay, you can browse available homes on the map or through the dashboard, and connect with volunteers directly through the app.

We hope SafeHouse can provide support and assistance to those affected by wildfires in British Columbia.

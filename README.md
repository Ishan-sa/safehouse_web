# SafeHouse

## General info

Welcome to the SafeHouse!

SafeHouse is a solution to help evacuees connect with hosts who provide accommodations during an evacuation order. Those willing to offer a space can register their space as a “Safe House”. Listings appear on a map with information such as amount of space, whereabouts, and contact to create an efficient process to get others to a secure place in disaster situations.
